# 💰 Eth TipJar

**Now YOU TOO can have a wallet connect button on your site & receive tips to your friends!**

Note: This is a *beta* project by [fiigmnt](https://twitter.com/fiigmnt) and the [wagmi](https://weallgonnamake.it)//[mirage](https://mirage.wtf) team. use *at your own risk* 😇

## Development

This project was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). 
To get started:

- clone the repo
- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`
- good to go!

`tipjar.js` is the heavy lifter here and I'm sure could use some clean up. There is no automated minifier & upload to the CDN (there's no CDN). If you want to make a PR that includes changes, I'll manually update for now ✌️
